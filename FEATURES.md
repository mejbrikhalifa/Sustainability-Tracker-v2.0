## ⏱️ Advanced Feature 3: Hourly/Seasonal Carbon Intensity

### Overview
Analyze how grid carbon intensity varies over 24 hours and optimize appliance scheduling.

### Seasonal Profiles (8 patterns)

#### Standard Patterns
1. **Flat** - Minimal variation (~±5%)
2. **Evening Peak** - Summer AC usage drives high evening intensity
3. **Winter Dual Peak** - Morning + evening heating demand

#### Enhanced Seasonal
4. **Spring Solar** - Low midday intensity (renewable peak)
5. **Autumn Transition** - Moderate variation

#### Region-Specific (Auto-detected)
6. **Solar-Heavy** (CA, AU, CL) - Dramatic midday dip, high evening peak
7. **Wind-Heavy** (UK, NO, DE) - Variable with night lows
8. **Coal-Heavy** (PL, IN, CN) - Flatter profiles with modest peaks

### Auto-Detection Logic
- **Solar >15%** → Solar-heavy pattern
- **Wind >20%** → Wind-heavy pattern
- **Coal >50%** → Coal-heavy pattern
- **Default** → Seasonal pattern

### Visualization
- **Color-coded gradient chart**: Green (low) → Yellow (medium) → Red (high)
- **Interactive tooltips**: Hour, intensity, zone

## 🌍 Impact Examples

### Individual Impact
**Average daily emissions by region:**
- 🇳🇴 Norway (hydro-heavy): 5-8 kg CO₂/day
- 🇫🇷 France (nuclear-heavy): 8-12 kg CO₂/day
- 🇪🇺 EU Average: 12-18 kg CO₂/day
- 🇺🇸 US Average: 18-25 kg CO₂/day
- 🇨🇳 China (coal-heavy): 20-30 kg CO₂/day

### Optimization Potential
**Typical savings from load shifting:**
- Small household: 50-100 kg CO₂/year
- Medium household: 150-300 kg CO₂/year
- Large household with EV: 300-500 kg CO₂/year

**Equivalent to:**
- 50 kg = 200 km driving
- 150 kg = 1 short-haul flight
- 300 kg = 1,200 km driving
- 500 kg = 2 long-haul flights
